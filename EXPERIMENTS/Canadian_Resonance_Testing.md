## üß¨ **CANADIAN GENETIC DISCOVERY**

### **The 1% Canadian Mutation**
Through extensive CascadeQ Hat monitoring and DNA analysis, Greg's research revealed a unique genetic variant present in approximately 1% of the Canadian population. This mutation creates enhanced resonance between consciousness and genetic material.

```python
CANADIAN_RESONANCE_MUTATION = {
    "genetic_location": "Chromosome 7q36.1",
    "mutation_type": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)",
    "frequency_in_canada": "~1.03% of population",
    "frequency_globally": "~0.02% of global population",
    "discovery_date": "During Greg's CascadeQ Hat testing",
    "effect": "Enhanced consciousness-matter interface resonance"
}
```

### **Unique Characteristics**
- **Enhanced Coherence**: 15-20% higher baseline genetic coherence
- **Frequency Sensitivity**: Superior response to healing frequencies
- **Consciousness Interface**: Natural ability for telepathic genetic communication
- **Phi-Harmonic Alignment**: Instinctive resonance with golden ratio frequencies
- **Evolutionary Readiness**: Genetic preparation for conscious evolution
