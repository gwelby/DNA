## **GUIDE RNA STRUCTURE** (Single Guide RNA - sgRNA)

### **sgRNA Components**
```
Total length: ~100 nucleotides
Design: Fusion of crRNA + tracrRNA

crRNA region (5' end):
- Spacer sequence: 20 nucleotides (target complementarity)
- Repeat sequence: 12 nucleotides (Cas9 binding)
- Function: Target DNA recognition and binding

tracrRNA region (3' end):
- Bulge: 5 nucleotides (positions 15-19)
- Stem loops: 3 hairpin structures
- Function: Cas9 protein recruitment and activation
- Conservation: Highly conserved across species
```

### **Guide RNA:Target DNA Interaction**
```
Seed sequence: Positions 1-8 from 5' end (most critical)
- Mismatches: 0-1 tolerated in seed region
- Specificity: Primary determinant of on-target binding
- Selection: Choose targets with minimal off-target potential

Extended region: Positions 9-20
- Mismatches: 2-4 may be tolerated
- Context: Depends on position and type
- PAM-distal: More tolerance than PAM-proximal
- Bulges: RNA or DNA bulges decrease activity

PAM requirement:
- SpCas9: 5'-NGG-3' (N = any nucleotide)
- Frequency: Every 8 bp on average in human genome
- Recognition: Essential for initial target binding
- Variants: Different Cas9 orthologs have different PAMs
```

### **R-loop Formation**
```
Mechanism:
1. PAM recognition by Cas9 C-terminal domain
2. Local DNA unwinding and strand invasion
3. Guide RNA:target strand base pairing (Watson-Crick)
4. Non-target strand displacement (single-strand)
5. Propagation of R-loop from PAM toward 5' end

Kinetics:
- Initial binding: Milliseconds (PAM recognition)
- R-loop formation: 1-10 seconds (full hybridization)
- Proofreading: Cas9 can dissociate if mismatches detected
- Cleavage: 1-60 seconds after complete R-loop formation

Stability:
- Perfect match: Stable R-loop, efficient cleavage
- Mismatches: Reduced stability, lower cleavage efficiency
- Length: Shorter guides (17-18 nt) may improve specificity
- Temperature: Higher temperatures reduce off-target binding
```

## **CLEAVAGE MECHANISM** (Dual Nuclease Activity)

### **Coordinated Cleavage**
```
Target strand cleavage (HNH domain):
- Mechanism: Two-metal-ion mechanism
- Metals: Mg2+ coordinates His840 and Asn854
- Chemistry: Nucleophilic attack on phosphodiester bond
- Product: 3'-hydroxyl + 5'-phosphate
- Timing: Occurs first in sequence

Non-target strand cleavage (RuvC domain):
- Mechanism: Similar two-metal-ion mechanism  
- Active site: Asp10, Glu762, His982
- Chemistry: Nucleophilic attack 3 bp upstream of PAM
- Product: 3'-hydroxyl + 5'-phosphate
- Timing: Occurs 1-5 seconds after target strand

Coordination:
- Allosteric: HNH cleavage activates RuvC cleavage
- Spatial: 3 bp stagger in cleavage sites
- Result: Blunt-ended double-strand break
- Repair: Cellular DNA repair pathways activated
```

### **Cleavage Efficiency**
```
On-target efficiency:
- Perfect match: 70-95% cleavage efficiency
- Single mismatch: 10-80% (position dependent)
- Multiple mismatches: <10% efficiency
- PAM variants: Reduced efficiency with non-canonical PAMs

Factors affecting efficiency:
- Chromatin state: Open chromatin > closed chromatin
- Cell cycle: S/G2 phases more permissive
- Target sequence: Some sequences inherently better
- Cas9 concentration: Saturation improves consistency
- Guide RNA design: Secondary structure affects loading

Off-target scoring:
